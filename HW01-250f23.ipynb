    "1. How to use Jupyter notebooks to not just run code, but also present text enriched by links, images, videos, etc.\n",
    "2. Convert linear systems of equations into matrix equations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are made of **cells**. You are currently reading the contents of a cell.  You can create a cell below this cell by pressing 'Esc' to ensure that the vertical bar on the left of the cell is blue, then pressing 'b' (which stands for \"below\"). You can also create a cell above this cell by pressing 'a'.  You can delete a cell by pressing 'dd' (two d's).  You can undo an action by pressing 'z'.  (I've locked this cell so that it cannot be deleted or edited).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells can be run by pressing 'Shift' and 'Enter' at the same time. Note that this moves the cursor to the next cell below, creating a cell if you're at the bottom of the notebook.  If you want to stay inside the cell, use 'Ctrl-Enter'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If keyboards make you uncomfortable, you can also use your mouse to accomplish all the above functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cell Types\n",
    "Cells can be of one of two types.  They can be either a *markdown* cell, or a *code* cell.  You are currently looking at a markdown cell. When a cell is created, it is, by default, a code cell.  You can make it a markdown cell by pressing 'm' or by using the dropdown menu above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown\n",
    "If you double click this markdown cell, or if you press 'Enter' while in this cell, you can see that \"behind the scenes\" markdown cells are really just plain text.  \"Markdown\" is a sort of simple typesetting language which converts plain text into fancy text. Notice how I was able to generate enumerated lists, section headers, bolded texts, and italicized texts also using plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a link to an external site with a simple markdown cheatsheet: __[link](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watson-studio-local/1.2.3?topic=notebooks-markdown-jupyter-cheatsheet)__\n",
