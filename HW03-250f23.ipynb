    "## Computational costs\n",
    "Computation is always a finite resource.  As such, it is important to understand the computational costs associated with operations that we carry out with our computers.  Furthermore, some algorithms, though they can be proven to solve a problem, may be so computationally expensive that running the algorithm to completion would take longer than the time before the heat death of the universe is expected to occur!  \n",
    "\n",
    "(**An aside:** This idea is what lies at the heart of cryptography.  There are certain types of problems which are very computationally expensive for computers to solve, but for which proposed solutions are easy to verify.  For instance, suppose you have the product $pq$ of two very large prime numbers $p$ and $q$.  If you are handed two numbers, it is easy to verify that $pq$ is $p$ times $q$ -- even for very very large integers multiplication is pretty fast.  However, finding $p$ and $q$, given only $pq$ is very difficult -- for some large numbers, though we have known algorithms for factoring any number, the expected runtime of such an algorithm might take longer than the expected time until heat death of the universe.  This observation lies at the heart of some cryptographic protocols such as RSA encryption).\n",

    "Let's investigate the computational costs associated with arithmetic operations on matrices.  To do this, we are going to use the `time` package in python. We can use the functions in `time` to see how long various processes take in python.  The longer a process takes, the more computational cost we associate with the process.\n",
